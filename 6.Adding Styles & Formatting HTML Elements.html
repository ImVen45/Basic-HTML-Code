            The Milky Way is the galaxy that includes the Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: 
            a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye.
            In night sky observing, although all the individual naked-eye stars in the entire sky are part of the Milky Way, the term "Milky Way" is limited to this band of light.
            The light originates from the accumulation of unresolved stars and other material located in the direction of the galactic plane.

        <p style="padding: 16px; font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5;">
            The concentration of stars in a band adds to the evidence that the Milky Way is a spiral galaxy. 
            If we lived in an elliptical galaxy, we would see the stars of our galaxy spread out all around the sky, not in a single band. 
            An all-sky image shows the flat plane of the Milky Way galaxy.
            Our Solar System is about 25,000 light years away from the center of our galaxy â€“ we live in the suburbs of our galaxy. 
            Just as the Earth goes around the Sun, the Sun goes around the center of the Milky Way.
