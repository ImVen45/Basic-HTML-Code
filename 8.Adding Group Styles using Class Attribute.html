                Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), 
                god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς).

                Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. 
                It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. 
                It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. 
                Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture.

                Neptune is the eighth and farthest known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, 
                it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. 
                It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.
